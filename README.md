# Mobile phone portfolio
## What does my app do and look like ?
> [!NOTE]
I created this application to practice coding in html / css and javascript but above all to create a portfolio (i'm pretty happy with the result). The image you see is the first page on which you can click to see various buttons on my other works.

> [!NOTE]
There are various buttons linked to my other websites, which I use as a portfolio to show what I can do. I leave it up to you to watch my work ðŸ˜Ž
